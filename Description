Grassroots AI: Monitoring and Mitigating Climate Effects in Sub-Saharan Africa
Project Description:
Sub-Saharan Africa, with its diverse ecosystems and communities, stands at the forefront of climate impacts. Our proposal focuses on creating an AI-driven platform to monitor environmental changes in this region, helping communities adapt and make informed decisions. The system will be particularly attuned to agricultural practices, water sources, and land use changes, crucial elements that sustain the majority of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa.
