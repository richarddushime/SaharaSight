# Grassroots AI: Monitoring and Mitigating Climate Effects in Sub-Saharan Africa
## What is it?
Grassroots AI is an open-source initiative focused on creating 
an AI-driven platform tailored for the unique challenges and needs of Sub-Saharan Africa. 
By harnessing real-time environmental data and advanced analytics, 
the platform provides actionable insights related to agriculture, water resources, and land use changes.
Designed with user-friendly interfaces and data visualization tools, it assists communities, 
especially farmers, in understanding and adapting to rapidly shifting environmental conditions.
## Goals:
Empower Local Communities: Equip communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
particularly farmers, with data-driven insights to optimize their agricultural practices, 
safeguard water sources, and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change.
Promote Sustainable Practices: By offering timely predictions on weather patterns, potential droughts, and crop diseases, 
we aim to promote sustainability, ensuring long-term food security and ecological balance.
Foster Collaborative Growth: By keeping the platform open source, we encourage researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to contribute, refine, and expand the system's capabilities.
Educational Outreach: Organize community workshops to ensure the effective utilization of the tool, while also educating on the significance of environmental conservation.
